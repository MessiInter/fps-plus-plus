FPS++ is a **client-side** (**server-side** is currently unsupported) or modpack comprised of the **best performance mods** (e.g. Sodium, Starlight and Lithium, along with many more) and libraries/API mods (e.g. Fabric API and Fabric Language Kotlin) that significantly improves rendering performance, logic performance, memory usage, and more - all without compromising on the game's vanilla looks and features! Because of this simplicity, the modpack is compatible with a very wide range of devices and can be updated to the latest versions very quickly. Want more features? No problem! FPS++ serves as a great foundation for performance - simply add your favorite mods on top.

FPS++ can be installed on both clients and servers, so this list tells you what is installed depending on the environment.

# ðŸ“¥ Installation Guide

**Please be sure to read Sodium's [Driver Compatibility](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility) section on the wiki before installing FPS++. It contains some important instructions on preventing crashes and other performance issues.**

If you would like to install the modpack, you can install the modpack with a third party launcher (e.g. MultiMC and Modrinth).

After installing the modpack, you can easily add your favorite mods so long as they are compatible with the Minecraft version you are playing on.
